# Project 2

learning HTML was generally easy for most elements, although it was hard to remember everything. The website made it easy to go back and look at the more in-depth elements like maps and images. Remembering the buttons was the most difficult for me, but the basic 4 setup elements were easy for me to remember as we used them on every assignment.

I really like design so I am excited to learn more about CSS. I do not know much about CSS, but I feel like regardless there will be lots of references online to help with any issues that arise.

I had a lot of trouble with tables and little things throughout this assignment. There were many times I got frustrated trying to get things to work. This assignment was time consuming. I started with going through the website content then went on to the assignment. I spent a lot of time going back and forth between the website, notes and atom to get my assignment done.
