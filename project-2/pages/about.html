  <p>I chose this recipe because it is a family favorite and is super easy to make for any holiday or occasion. My grandmother and mom taught
    how to make this recipe so it is special to me and that is another reason for making this particular site. I hope everyone who tried it will
    enjoy it as much as I do! Below you can find references to view how to make other versions of Potatoes O'Brien as well as some history behind
    the Irish recipe.</p>
