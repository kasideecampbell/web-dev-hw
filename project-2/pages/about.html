  <p>I chose this recipe because it is a family favorite and is super easy to make for any holiday or occasion. My grandmother and mom taught
    how to make this recipe so it is special to me and that is another reason for making this particular site. I hope everyone who tried it will
    enjoy it as much as I do! Below you can find references to view how to make other versions of Potatoes O'Brien as well as some history behind
    the Irish recipe.</p>

<h3 style="color:black">Potatoes O'Brien History</h3>
<p><q>Potatoes O’Brien, a dish of fried potatoes with chopped bell peppers and onions has long been associated with St. Patrick’s Day and Ireland, but did you know that the dish actually originated in the United States?
Yep, right here in the USA! There is some debate around which city, but rumor has it either Manhattan or Boston. My vote is on Boston, seeing there is a much higher saturation of Irish folks there. It was actually named after the Irish cook, who was bored with typical fried potatoes. He decided to liven them up a bit by adding some color.<q></p>
