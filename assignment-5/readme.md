You would consider third party media for a multitude of reasons, but the main reason would be the potential cost associated with self-hosted media opposed to free third party media.

My work cycle for this assignment was similar to my past assignments. I found this assignment easier than the last. I began by going through the material on the course website and took good notes so I wouldn't have to constantly go back and forth which saved some time. Once I worked through the assignment I had to go back and edit multiple times to get everything right. Overall I learned a lot of new code which will be useful in other classes
