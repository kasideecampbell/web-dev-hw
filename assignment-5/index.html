  <h1>Black or White by Michael Jackson Lyrics</h1>
  <p>took my baby on a Saturday bang<br />
   Boy is that girl with you<br />
   Yes we're one and the same<br />

   Now I believe in miracles<br />
   And a miracle has happened tonight<br />

   But, if you're thinkin' about my baby<br />
   It don't matter if you're black or white<br />

   They print my message in the Saturday Sun<br />
   I had to tell them I ain't second to none<br />

   And I told about equality and it's true<br />
   Either you're wrong or you're right<br />

   But, if you're thinkin' about my baby<br />
   It don't matter if you're black or white<br />

   I am tired of this devil<br />
   I am tired of this stuff<br />
   I am tired of this business<br />
   Sew when the going gets rough
   I ain't scared of your brother<br />
   I ain'ts scared of no sheets<br />
   I ain't scared of nobody<br />
   Girl when the goin' gets mean<br />

   Protection<br />
   For gangs, clubs, and nations<br />
   Causing grief in human relations<br />
   It's a turf war on a global scale<br />
   I'd rather hear both sides of the tale<br />
   See, it's not about races<br />
   Just places<br />
   Faces<br />
   Where your blood comes from<br />
   Is were your space is<br />
   I've seen the bright get duller<br />
   I'm not going to spend my life being a color<br />

   Don't tell me you agree with me<br />
   When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye<br />

   But, if you're thinkin' about my baby<br />
   It don't matter if you're black or white<br />

   I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby<br />
   It don't matter if you're black or white<br />

   I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother<br />
   It don't matter if you're black or white<br />

   Ooh, ooh<br />
   Yea, yea, yea now<br />
   Ooh, ooh<br />
   Yea, yea, yea now<br />

   It's black, it's white<br />
   It's tough for them to get by<br />
   It's black, it's white, (x3) whoo<br />
