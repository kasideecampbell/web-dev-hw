# Assignment 4 readme

Alt text provides alternative information for an image if the user cannot view it. It should give a good description of the image and is used solely for decoration.

Forms are used to gather user input to be processed into a database or kept in a text file as a paper form.

My work cycle for this assignment was pretty much the same as the other assignment I have completed. I began by going through and studying the course content on the course website. After I finished reading through the course content I read through the Moodle assignment and went over the example. Once I got a good idea of what the assignment should look like I began going through the steps in order. I had some trouble with formatting errors as I started pushing to my repo, but I finally got my formatting.
