# Project 1 Technical Report

1. Google Chrome- web browsers use web languages to write the instructions they then translate this language and render into the
visual design of the website layout which includes text, images and more. Some common web languages are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I found the Wayback Machine so interesting! I really liked being about to look back and see how far web design and usability have
come since the mid-1990's. I visited Amazon.com in the year 2000 and some differences were very chaotic links everywhere and the
visuals and pictures you now see on Amazon were non-existent in the year 2000. Along with very basic text and tab layout.

I found the new HTML coding very easy to use so far. I did not get held up too much. I have done some web design in the past and
I found GoDaddy to be a super easy and user friendly place to get a cheap domain name and hosting. Getting through all the work was]]
time consuming, but I learned a lot and didn't struggle too much through the steps.
