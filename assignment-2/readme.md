New readme for assignment 2
# Assignment 2

Version control system is a system that records changes made to files
so you can recall a specific version of the file at any time. This helps
ensure that the user can go back and review changes over time and revert back to old versions if needed. We are using VCS in this class to help up track our progress and help us recover files if we mess up or lose them.

[My response to Assignment 2](./assignment-2/response,txt)

The work cycle for this assignment was easy to follow and flowed nicely. I had some trouble initially understanding Github, but I got better as I walked through the steps. I enjoyed the readings and videos for this week as they cleared up some big topics for me. In addition I enjoyed getting more experience working in Atom.
