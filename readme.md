 # My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## Kasidee Campbell
I decided to take this class to enhance my skills for Management Information Systems major so I can stand out after graduation!

I learned from the Internet Q&A section that:

1. I learned that the Internet was originally built for the defense department.

2. The internet connects participants and the web connects information.

3. I never knew how information of the internet came to be organized as we learned Tim Berner Lee's method of links and references, "web" and hypertext, that is still used today
