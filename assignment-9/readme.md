# Assignment 8

Padding is the amount of space betwwen the inner content of the element and the element itself.Padding adds space between the element and the border. The border is used to determine the amount of space the element can take up but unlike margins and padding it has multiple style options. Margins is the space between an element and other elements.

The positioning was the hardest task for me. Since there was a lot of attention to detail in this assignment it look a lot of time to finish which was hard during finals week.

I stated by going through the readings which I didn't find very helpful so I used videos from Youtube for reference. I ended up having to redo the assignment because I didnt go step by step I added everything and then tried to position which made it difficult
