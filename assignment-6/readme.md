# This is my Readme for Assignment 6

My design process for this project was to look through the different decades and the 80's color and designs stood out the best to me. I tried to style my page to reflect the neon colors and shapes of the 80's with dots, boxes and some 80's images.

My color palette included three or four colors which include:
1. magenta
2. indigo
3. turquoise
4. yellow

I started by reading through the website and taking some notes. I knew putting css to the test would prove to be more challenging since its a new topic. I started by choosing my decade, color palette, looking at the example and started coding my index.html first. I then started my css and pushed it from github to make sure I could check and make sure my css adjustments were showing up. I did get frsutrated with positioning objects and it was taking forever to push my edits to my live website which made the assignment consume a lot of time.
