There is no limit to how many head and body elements a page can have. Head elements tell the browser and processor information about the HTML document such as the meta data, links the page may need to load, the style, the viewpoint of the dimensions of the device accessing the page and the title of the document. The body elements, the guts of the site, is the data that is rendered by the browser and populates on the clients computer. There are two types of markup in the body structural markup and semantic markup.

The difference between structural and semantic markup is structural markup helps to guide the user through the document. Structural markup includes elements like headings, paragraphs, breaks and lists. Structural elements are then used by the browser and DOM to comprehend the document content. Semantic markup is used to emphasis the meaning of the content. This includes creating quotes, bold words, superscripts, definitions, citations and much more.

I began my work cycle for this assignment by reading and following along with the content on our class website. I then read though the assignment and got an idea for all aspects of the assignment. I finished by going step-by-step through each requirement to finish assignment 3. I felt that this assignment was easy to follow and I also found many resources online that helped when I got confused on how to format the html code.
