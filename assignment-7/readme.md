# Readme for Assignment 7
I went with the 1912 New York Times excerpt from when the Titantic Sank
I chose the Old English font that people often associate with the New York Times. I also picked an older looking color scheme by going with neutrals.

## Font Info
 Web fonts are made available by a server and are not preinstalled on a persons computers. Web-safe fonts can be accessed with confidence of availability. System fonts preinstalled fonts that are on your computer. They usually come with your IOS and are ready to use. One drawback of using system fonts is they will sometimes work on your computer but not on a website. Fallback fonts are there if the first font specified does not work. This allows the browser to search for fallback fonts . A default font is there in case the fonts being called
 are not working.

## Work Cycle
The work cycle or this project was pretty simple. I worked through the website information and then began working on my code. The CSS code has gotten easier since doing the last project. I feel like the instruction were straight forward and easy to follow so this assignment went quicker than the rest. The activities that took the most time was finding fonts and selecting an article.
