    <p>CAPE RACE, N.F., April 15. -- The White Star liner Olympic reports by wireless this evening that the
      Cunarder Carpathia reached, at daybreak this morning, the position from which wireless calls for help
      were sent out last night by the Titanic after her collision with an iceberg. The Carpathia found only
      the lifeboats and the wreckage of what had been the biggest steamship afloat. The Titanic had foundered
      at about 2:20 A.M., in latitude 41:46 north and longitude 50:14 west. This is about 30 minutes of latitude,
      or about 34 miles, due south of the position at which she struck the iceberg. All her boats are accounted
      for and about 655 souls have been saved of the crew and passengers, most of the latter presumably women and
      children. There were about 1,200 persons aboard the Titanic. The Leyland liner California is remaining and
      searching the position of the disaster, while the Carpathia is returning to New York with the survivors.
      It can be positively stated that up to 11 o'clock to-night nothing whatever had been received at or heard
      by the Marconi station here to the effect that the Parisian, Virginian or any other ships had picked up any
      survivors, other than those picked up by the Carpathia.</p>
