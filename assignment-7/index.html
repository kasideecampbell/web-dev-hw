    <p>CAPE RACE, N.F., April 15. -- The White Star liner Olympic reports by wireless this evening that the<br />
      Cunarder Carpathia reached, at daybreak this morning, the position from which wireless calls for help<br />
      were sent out last night by the Titanic after her collision with an iceberg. The Carpathia found only<br />
      the lifeboats and the wreckage of what had been the biggest steamship afloat. The Titanic had foundered<br />
      at about 2:20 A.M., in latitude 41:46 north and longitude 50:14 west. This is about 30 minutes of latitude,<br />
      or about 34 miles, due south of the position at which she struck the iceberg. All her boats are accounted<br />
      for and about 655 souls have been saved of the crew and passengers, most of the latter presumably women and<br />
      children. There were about 1,200 persons aboard the Titanic. The Leyland liner California is remaining and<br />
      searching the position of the disaster, while the Carpathia is returning to New York with the survivors.<br />
      It can be positively stated that up to 11 o'clock to-night nothing whatever had been received at or heard<br />
      by the Marconi station here to the effect that the Parisian, Virginian or any other ships had picked up any<br />
      survivors, other than those picked up by the Carpathia.</p>
